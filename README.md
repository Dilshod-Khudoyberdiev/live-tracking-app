# live-tracking-app
 This project provides the initial code for live map tracking of buses using Leaflet (a js library) and OpenStreetMap. It tracks and updates the user's live location on the map in real-time, serving as a foundation for a comprehensive bus tracking system. Future enhancements will include tracking multiple buses and improved user interface.
